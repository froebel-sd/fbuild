# fbuild

this repo is intended to host fbuild, the initial, basic build system for froebel.

fbuild's current iteration is hosted under the main [froebel](https://github.com/froebel-sd/froebel) repository at the moment.

fbuild should be moved here, cleaned up, and prepared to work in a systemwide installation, preferably also with some
helper scripts for simple package management tasks - eventually to be superseded by [origami](https://github.com/froebel-sd/origami).
